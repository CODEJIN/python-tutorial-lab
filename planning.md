# Planning for Python tutorial

## Prep for everyone to do

* Installing python:
  * I'd like to teach in 3.x (where x ~= 5) so that people can actually use it in the future, but maybe make notes of where it  differs from 2.7 for PsychoPy purposes
  * Distrib link to [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* Get git: (there's a pun in there somewhere)
  * [Download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  * 3rd party GUI tools if interested (recommended; git's own GUI tools are bad)
    * [All](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
    * [GitUp](http://gitup.co/) for visually-oriented Mac users
    * [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for Windows and Mac. Made by GitHub (good for integration with GitHub), medium in features and technical level
    * [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Fairly technical, but clean and powerful (except don't use `~/` because it will *make a directory called `~`*), great name
* I'll show people how to get the materials from GH at the meeting, but they'll be available in advance for the precocious

## Prep for me

* Distribute links to Python and Git by 10/6 (preferably 10/5)
* Make list of resources for further study (codecademy, sololearn, etc.)
* Find Paul's JTerm notebook
* Pick format
  * I'm thinking present an idea and then tell pepole to write a tiny version ("This is a print statement. This is a string. Print 'Hello world!')
  * Maaayyybe something like what Nodeschool does?
* Pick topics

## Topics to cover

* How to actually run a python program, and/or the interpreter
* Strings, print
* Variables
* Other data types, including lists
* Iteration
* Control flow
* Basic objects (I imagine attributes and methods are important in PsychoPy)

## Resources

* Codecademy
* Codeschool
* HackerRank
